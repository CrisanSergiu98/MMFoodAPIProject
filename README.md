# Scope
This is a portfolio project and the main purpose is to show of some of my code to potential employers.
But I am going to release this API so any developer can use it for free in their projects.

# Summary
We have tree main projects: a SQLServer Project, an ASP.Net Api and a DesktopUi(WPF).
Everything will use the .Net Framework initially because i want to simulate like a post-production update or in any case the transition between .NetFramewok and .NetCore.

# Minimal Viable Product
So I just wanted to make any users/viewers/whatever that I'm going to be focusing on getting this done. Meaning that for now the user experience will be somewhat limited. 
For example, when this gets released the users will not have the option to add new ingredients, categories, ingredient categories and such. The main user experience will be to create, edit and delete recipes.
I'm planning to add user based visibility for newly added ingredients, categories and such, and then if you want to make your recipe public you will need to register them for like public use or something along those lines.
