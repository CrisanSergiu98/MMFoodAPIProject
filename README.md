# Scope
This is a portfolio project and the main purpose is to show of some of my code to potential employers.
But I am going to release this API so any developer can use it for free in their projects.

# Summary
We have tree main projects: a SQLServer Project, an ASP.Net Api and a DesktopUi(WPF).
Everything will use the .Net Framework initially because i want to simulate like a post-production update or in any case the transition between .NetFramewok and .NetCore.
